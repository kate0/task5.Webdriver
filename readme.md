# WebDriver JS
#1. Select a system under test (preferable: web application being tested during your project activities);
#2.	Agree with your mentor and document a scenario to automate. The scenario should be linear (no need to #   implement complex logic for now) and contain 8-10 simple steps (open a page, send keys, click, etc);
#3.	Use WebDriver API as much as possible (browser navigation, clicks, switchTo and etc.);
#4.	Use several locator strategies i.e. different types of locators (and select the most suitable in your #   case);
#5.	Experiment with waits (implicit and explicit).
